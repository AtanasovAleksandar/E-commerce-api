When set to 1 mph, the system can slowly pulse power to the wheels, which helps to rock the truck out of sand if it’s stuck.\",\"price\":33000,\"categoryId\":160,\"id\":35}",

It has a 575-hp version of the Hellcat’s infamous 707-hp supercharged 6.2-liter V-8. A full-fat, 707-hp version of the Rebel will arrive in 2020.\\n\\nThe TRX is more trophy truck than NASTRUCK. Ram says it will be able to cruise at more than 100 mph off-road. With 13 inches of suspension travel and massive 37-inch tires (at least on the concept), the Rebel will be capable of some serious off-road antics.\",\"price\":16000,\"categoryId\":159,\"id\":36}",

The Goliath 6x6 is the latest Hennessey megatruck, and compared to last year’s angular Velociraptor 6x6 and the brand’s 300-mph Venom F5, the Goliath almost looks subdued. In truth, it is anything but.\\n\\nTo create the Goliath, Hennessey takes a 2019 Chevrolet Silverado Trail Boss Z71 and adds a lift kit and a supercharger, a few other extras, and an “additional axle, wheels, tires, and brakes.” You’re left with a 705-hp, $375,000 monstrosity that brings with it another two feet of pickup bed and more attention than you can handle.\",\"price\":34000,\"categoryId\":162,\"id\":37}",

It can fold one way to provide a step—useful when stepping out of the AT4’s high bed—another to extend the bed.\\n\\nGM has long been fond of heads-up displays, and the AT4 features a big 15-inch version. The physical screen in the center console has a clever “Surround Vision” mode, which stitches several camera feeds together.

To cope with the larger tires, the Power Wagon has shorter 4.10 gears. Both front and rear differentials can be locked to help the big brute scramble up rough terrain.\\n\\nWhen the going gets really tough, there is a button that disconnects the front sway bar, which allows more suspension articulation and better off-road performance. If you manage to get the big truck stuck, a 12,000-pound Warn winch mounted in the front bumper will help get it moving again.\",\"price\":34000,\"categoryId\":158,\"id\":39}",

The 525-hp supercharged V-8 means the SVX can keep up with just about anything and probably could crack 150 mph. But it’s also good at going slowly.

The Pro-4X package brings Bilstein monotube off-road dampers, all-terrain tires, a radiator skid plate, an electronic locking rear differential and hill-descent control. You also get a an off-road gauge that uses an accelerometer to display pitch and roll angles, allowing you to reassure your passengers that you're not quite at the tip-over angle on a side hill. The Pro-4X is also tall—the step-in height is nearly two feet—and packs 390 horsepower from its 5.6-liter V-8, so go ahead and plunge into that mudhole.\",\"price\":23018,\"categoryId\":163,\"id\":41}"
